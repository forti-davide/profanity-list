# Profanity List

## How did the project come about?
I was searching the Internet for a list where all the banned words were listed to block them on a site I manage. After spending some time researching, I noticed that there is no all-inclusive list, but that, there are lists divided by nationality.

## What is the purpose of this project?
Have a github action that every day around 11pm performs a merge of all the banned word lists in the repo into one big list.
